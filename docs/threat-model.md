# clet Threat Model

> **Status:** Published at v0.5. Expands the sketch in `specs/clet-spec.md` Appendix A.

## Scope

This document covers the attack surface of the `clet` CLI binary (`src/Clet/`) as shipped in v1.0. It does not cover the Terminal.Gui library itself (that's TG's responsibility), CI/CD pipeline security (covered in `docs/runbooks/release-rollback.md`), or post-v1.0 plugin loading.

## Trust boundaries

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The trust boundary is between the shell/agent layer and the clet CLI host. Everything above that line is untrusted input.

## Untrusted inputs

| Input | Entry point | Threat |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `--initial <value>` | `CommandLineRoot.DispatchAlias` | Injection into View text fields |
| `--title <text>` | `CommandLineRoot.DispatchAlias` | Terminal escape injection via window title |
| `--<opt> <value>` | `CommandLineRoot.DispatchAlias` | Per-clet option values (e.g. `--options` for select) |
| Positional arguments | `CletRunOptions.Arguments` | File paths (path traversal), label text |
| stdin | `Console.In.ReadToEnd()` | Arbitrary content for `clet md` |
| File content | `File.ReadAllText()` in `MarkdownClet` | Malicious Markdown (script injection, link abuse) |
| Environment variables | `ConfigurationManager` (TG) | Theme/config override |

## Mitigations

### Terminal escape sanitization

**Threat:** An attacker passes terminal escape sequences (C0/C1 control codes) in `--title`, `--initial`, positional arguments, or markdown content (via `clet md`) to manipulate the terminal state (cursor repositioning, window title injection, clipboard access via OSC 52, hyperlink spoofing via OSC 8).

**Mitigation:** clet implements a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Input sanitization (TerminalEscapeSanitizer):** All user-supplied content is stripped of dangerous terminal control sequences *before* it reaches Terminal.Gui. The sanitizer removes ESC (`\x1b`), BEL (`\x07`), 8-bit CSI (`\x9b`), 8-bit OSC (`\x9d`), and C1 7-bit pairs (`\x1b@` through `\x1b_`). This filter runs at every code path that hands user content to the renderer:
   - `MarkdownClet`: inline content and file-loaded content are sanitized before assignment to `markdownView.Text`.
   - `MarkdownHelpRenderer.RenderToAnsi`: input markdown is sanitized before rendering, and a second pass on the rendered ANSI output strips any user-payload escape sequences that survived through TG rendering (while preserving the renderer's own SGR/cursor sequences).

2. **TG's cell model (defense-in-depth):** Terminal.Gui's View layer renders text through its own attribute/cell model. User-supplied strings become `Text` properties on Views, which are rendered cell-by-cell with explicit attributes. However, clet does **not** rely on TG to filter terminal escapes — the `TerminalEscapeSanitizer` is clet's own defense, applied before content reaches TG (see D-030).

**For JSON output (`--json`):** The `OutputFormatter` writes to stdout via `SchemaV1.ToJson()`, which uses `System.Text.Json` source-generated serialization. JSON string escaping handles control characters per RFC 8259 (e.g. `\u001b` for ESC). No raw user input reaches stdout unescaped.

**For plain-text output:** `OutputFormatter.Write` calls `stdout.WriteLine(value)` for the result value. If the value contains terminal escapes, they pass through to the terminal. This is acceptable because: (a) the value is the *result* of user interaction, not attacker-controlled input, and (b) `--json` mode is the recommended machine-readable path.

### `--title` sanitization

**Threat:** `--title` sets the TG window/border title. If the string contained escape sequences that leaked to the terminal, it could set the terminal window title (OSC 0/2) or worse.

**Mitigation:** TG's `Border` rendering draws the title string cell-by-cell through the driver's attribute model. The title string is never written raw to the terminal output stream. This is inherent to TG's architecture, not a clet-specific defense.

### Markdown link policy

**Threat:** A Markdown file rendered by `clet md` contains a link that, if followed, opens a browser to a malicious URL, exfiltrates data via URL parameters, or triggers an OS handler for a custom scheme (`file://`, `ssh://`, etc.).

**Mitigation:** Default link policy is `SurfaceOnly` (D-017):
- `LinkClicked` event handler shows the URL in the status bar and sets `e.Handled = true`.
- No link is ever opened automatically.
- No `Process.Start` or `ShellExecute` call exists anywhere in `src/`.
- AI agents running `clet md` on untrusted content are safe by default.

**`--allow-link-open` status:** v1.0 ships with the closed-by-default policy only. No `--allow-link-open` opt-in flag is wired up. The flag is reserved for a future release (v1.x or later) and will require explicit user acceptance of the documented risks (arbitrary URL scheme handling, potential data exfiltration via URL parameters). Until that flag ships, there is no code path that can open a link from rendered Markdown.

### File access scope

**Threat:** `clet md` could be used as an arbitrary file-read primitive in agent contexts. An indirect-prompt-injection could instruct an agent to run `clet md /home/$USER/.aws/credentials`, exfiltrating file contents via the rendered ANSI or `--cat` output. Similarly, glob patterns like `clet md '/etc/*.conf'` could enumerate and read multiple files.

**Mitigation (D-030):** `clet md` enforces a file-access confinement policy:

1. **Extension allowlist:** Only `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.txt` files are permitted by default.
2. **Working directory confinement:** Files must reside under the process working directory. Paths outside the cwd are refused.
3. **Per-file size cap:** 16 MiB maximum per file.
4. **Aggregate size cap:** 32 MiB maximum across all glob-expanded files.
5. **Glob file count cap:** Maximum 128 files per glob expansion.
6. **Binary content rejection:** Files containing NUL bytes in the first 8 KiB are refused (prevents accidentally rendering binary files).

**Escape hatches:**
- `--allow-file <path>` (repeatable): Explicitly allows a specific file path, bypassing extension and cwd checks. The file must still pass size and binary checks.
- `--allow-binary`: Permits binary content (disables NUL-byte detection).

**Rationale:** In agent contexts, positional arguments to `clet md` may be attacker-influenced. The default-deny policy prevents exfiltration while `--allow-file` provides an explicit opt-in for legitimate use cases where the caller controls the argument list.

**`pick-file` / `pick-directory` `--root` option:**
- `--root` sets the *starting directory* for the file picker dialog. It is **not** a sandbox.
- The user can navigate freely outside the root directory via the dialog's path bar.
- This is a deliberate design choice: the user is interactively choosing files, not an attacker. The OS file permission model is the sandboxing mechanism for interactive pickers.
- The help text explicitly documents this: "Starting directory (not a sandbox — user can navigate freely)."

### Plugin loading exclusion

**Threat:** Dynamic assembly loading (`Assembly.LoadFrom`, `Assembly.Load`) could execute arbitrary code from untrusted DLLs.

**Mitigation:** clet v1.0 does not load plugins, assemblies, or any user-supplied code. The clet registry (`BuiltInClets.RegisterAll`) is statically compiled. There is no extension point, no plugin directory, no `--load-assembly` flag. This is a deliberate v1.0 constraint (spec §2 out-of-scope).

NativeAOT publishing (`PublishAot=true`) further closes this surface: AOT binaries cannot load managed assemblies at runtime.

### Denial of service

**Threat:** Large files passed to `clet md`, extremely long `--initial` values, or high-frequency invocations.

**Mitigation:**
- `--timeout` flag enables callers to set an upper bound on execution time.
- `clet md` reads files with `File.ReadAllText()` — bounded by available memory, same as any CLI tool.
- No network I/O, no database, no shared state between invocations. Each `clet` invocation is a short-lived process.

### JSON output integrity

**Threat:** Consumers relying on `--json` output could be confused by malformed or unexpected JSON.

**Mitigation:**
- `SchemaV1` is the single serialization path for all JSON output.
- Source-generated `CletJsonContext` ensures AOT-safe, deterministic serialization.
- Contract tests (unit + smoke) validate every envelope shape: `ok`, `cancelled`, `error`, `no-result`.
- `schemaVersion: 1` is locked for clet 1.x; additive-only changes per §4.3.1.

## Release pipeline

### Script injection via workflow inputs

**Threat:** GitHub Actions interpolates `${{ github.event.* }}` expressions directly into `run:` scripts *before* the shell parses them. An attacker who controls a `repository_dispatch` payload (e.g. a compromised Terminal.Gui PAT) or a `workflow_dispatch` input (e.g. a compromised maintainer account) can inject arbitrary shell commands. The `resolve-version` job runs with `contents: write` + `issues: write` and the downstream `publish-nuget` job uses `secrets.NUGET_API_KEY`, making successful injection high-impact (backdoored NuGet package, exfiltrated secrets).

**Mitigation (D-029):** All user-controlled expressions (`github.event.client_payload.tg_version`, `github.event.inputs.tg_version`, `github.event.inputs.version_override`) are bound to step-level `env:` variables and only referenced as `$VAR` inside the `run:` script — the standard GitHub hardening pattern. Additionally, both inputs are validated against a strict allowlist regex (`^[0-9A-Za-z._+*-]+$`) before use; the step exits 2 if validation fails. See [GitHub's hardening guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#good-practices-for-mitigating-script-injection-attacks).

**What is not user-controlled:** `github.event_name` is runner-set metadata (not attacker-controllable), but it is also moved into `env:` for defense-in-depth.

## Out of scope for v1.0

- **Network access:** clet makes no network calls. No telemetry, no update checks, no remote content fetching.
- **Code signing verification:** clet does not verify its own signature at runtime. Code signing (D-012) is deferred post-1.0.
- **Multi-user / privilege separation:** clet is a single-user CLI tool. No daemon mode, no IPC, no shared state.
